Welcome to hapiPy3's documentation!
=====================================

The HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI) is a set of routines in 
Python which aims to provide remote access to functionality and data given by 
the HITRANonline.

Currently, the  [HITRANonline](http://hitran.org/hapi/) provides the hapi.py v1.0.0 for the users. While the script is written in Python2.x and related library.


Python is a great language for scientific computation, and Python3.x have more features for us to use.

We are currently working on porting the hapi to Python 3 and related library. 

One can refer to the article [why-you-should-move-to-python-3-now]_  for further reading.
